// The purpose of this module is to generate 32,896 "safe"
// <https://qntm.org/safe> Unicode code points suitable for use in the Base32768
// encoding. It makes use of the package `safe-code-point`
// <https://github.com/qntm/safe-code-point>.

// This program was run once, with the successful results immediately
// transplanted into `base32768` for use. It is kept here for historical reasons
// and to ensure reproducibility.

// This means the final 5 bits of the code point can be interpreted directly as
// bits in the original binary, and the lookup tables to decode the remaining 10
// or 2 bits are relatively small.
